      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>Global access to drinking water has improved, but it is still a problem in many areas. Here are some statistics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>785 million people lack basic drinking water services.</li>
        <li>2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with feces.</li>
        <li>Every day, over 800 children under age 5 die from diarrhea attributable to poor water and sanitation.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2> Importance of a Safe Water Supply in India</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Economic Burden</h3></li>
        <p>Waterborne diseases impose an economic burden of approximately <strong>USD 600 million</strong> annually in India, especially affecting drought- and flood-prone areas, which have impacted a third of the population recently.</p>

        <li><h3>Groundwater Depletion</h3></li>
        <p>Two-thirds of India's 718 districts face extreme water depletion. India, the world's highest user of groundwater, has rapidly depleted its supplies due to extensive drilling. Groundwater provides <strong>85%</strong> of rural and <strong>48%</strong> of urban drinking water needs (Source: JMP 2017).</p>

        <li><h3>Child Rights and Water Access</h3></li>
        <p>According to the Convention on the Rights of a Child, all children have the right to clean water and basic sanitation. UNICEF aims to ensure every child fulfills this right.</p>

        <li><h3>Impact on Education</h3></li>
        <p>Lack of a safe and reliable water source often forces women and children to collect water. This responsibility leads to decreased school attendance, with a <strong>22%</strong> increase in dropout rates reported in drought-affected states.</p>

        <li><h3>Women and Water Collection</h3></li>
        <p>Approximately <strong>54%</strong> of rural women and some adolescent girls spend an estimated <strong>35 minutes</strong> daily collecting water, equivalent to <strong>27 lost days' wages</strong> annually (Source: Analysis of the Situation of Children, Adolescents, and Women in India 2016).</p>

        <li><h3>Access to Safe Water</h3></li>
        <p>In 2015, India achieved <strong>93%</strong> coverage of access to improved water supply in rural areas. However, the shift to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) revealed that less than <strong>49%</strong> of the rural population uses safely managed drinking water (Source: JMP 2017).</p>

          <p>Groundwater is one of the most important sources for irrigation as well as for rural and urban domestic water supply. However, overexploitation of this valuable resource has led to its depletion.</p>
